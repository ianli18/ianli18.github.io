  <p>
    I am a first-year PhD student advised by Prof. Rose Yu and Prof. Loris D'Antoni. My research interests broadly lie at the intersection between machine learning and formal methods. Recently, I am particularly focusing on controllable generation with Large Language Models, with applications including (but not lmited to) AI4Science and Code Generation.

    Previously, I have worked with Prof. Guy Van den Broeck at UCLA on leveraging Tractable Probabilistic Models for controllable generation.
